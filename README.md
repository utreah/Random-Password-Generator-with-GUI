# Random Password Generator with GUI
 After a year I made password generator again but this time with a GUI and different programming language.\
 # UPDATE PASSWORD AS SLIDER CHANGES\
 -You can create a password from 6 letters long up to 18 letters long password.
 -It will automatically generate new password as you move the slider.
 <br>
 # COPY TO BOARD WITH ONE BUTTON\
 -You can copy the password to clipboard with one button.\
 -You cannot change the textbox manually.\
 <br>
 # TO DO:\
-Will add a function to automatically save the password inside a txt file.\
-.txt file name will be given by user.
-User can give name(s) to password(s) -> "facebook" "random password here" "length" "usedChars(1/2/3/4)"
