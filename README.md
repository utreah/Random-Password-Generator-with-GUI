# Random Password Generator with GUI

After a year, I've created a password generator again, but this time with a GUI and a different programming language.

## UPDATE PASSWORD AS SLIDER CHANGES
- You can create a password ranging from 6 letters to 18 letters in length.
- It will automatically generate a new password as you move the slider.

## COPY TO BOARD WITH ONE BUTTON
- You can copy the password to the clipboard with one button.
- You cannot interact with the textbox. It automatically locks the textbox after a password is generated.

## TO DO:
- Will add a function to automatically save the password inside a txt file.
- .txt file name will be given by the user.
- Users can give name(s) to password(s) -> "facebook" "random password here" "length" "usedChars(1/2/3/4)"
